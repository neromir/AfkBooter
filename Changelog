v1.2 - August 18, 2012
* converted project to maven for easier project maintenance by other devs (and myself)
* updated to Bukkit 1.3.1 AsyncChat compatibility

v1.1-beta1 - March 15, 2012
* R6 events update (no changes required to config files)
* fixed INVENTORY_OPEN with new events
* disabled alternate PLAYER_MOVE checks for now, on suspicion it may have been causing the occasional unexpected kick
* enabled Permission caching, since every event does a permission check (for exempt) and some permission systems are known to not be very efficient. Permission checks are cached for 60 seconds, which for frequently called events (PLAYER_MOVE, BLOCK_BREAK, etc) will significantly reduce the number of permission calls made.
* added ant build automation to source

v1.0.5 - February 1, 2012
* compiled against latest RB #1846, which fixes 1.1 compatibility issue

v1.0.4 - December 18, 2011
* fixed a bug related to HeroChat (and possibly other chat plugins?) in which chatting was not being counted towards player activity
* removed PLAYER_MOVE hook and switched to a more efficient polling cycle
* compiled against latest RB #1597

v1.0.3 - July 4, 2011
* last release from @Neromir
